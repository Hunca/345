# COSC345 Year Long Project - 8 Ball Pool

An 8 ball pool game which follows the concept of 'Small Is Beautiful'. We are aiming to create a program which is very lite, challenging, but enjoyable to play. Our game is for offline play, allowing for local player versus player, and a puzzle trickshot 
mode.

### Prerequisites

We are building this program using the C++ language on Windows based computers. However we will supply instructions on how to install the various components onto both Windows and MacOS.

### Installing
*For Windows:*
Step 1:


```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
Final Step:
You should now be able to build the program by entering:
```
make
```
in the directory of the project, and then run the program by entering:
```
app
```

## Running the program.

The program takes inputs from the keyboard and will not require the use of a mouse.
Here is a list of input keys for our program:
```
Left/Right Arrow Keys   | Changes direction of the cue on the cue ball.
Up/Down Arrow Keys      | Changes the power input of the shot.
Spacebar                | Initiates the shot to be made.
```
Exiting the program can be done by pressing:
```
alt + f4
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Coding Style

We will be coding our program following the K & R standard layout. 

```
void checknegative(x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        puts("Negative");
    } else {
        nonnegative(x);
    }
}
```
