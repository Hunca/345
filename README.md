# COSC345 Year Long Project - 8 Ball Pool

An 8 ball pool game which follows the concept of 'Small Is Beautiful'. We are aiming to create a program which is very lite, challenging, but enjoyable to play. Our game is for offline play, allowing for local player versus player, and a puzzle trickshot 
mode.

### Prerequisites

We are building this program using the C++ language on Windows based computers. However we will supply instructions on how to install the various components onto both Windows and MacOS.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Coding Style

We will be coding our program following the K & R standard layout. 

```
void checknegative(x) {
    if (x < 0) {
        puts("Negative");
    } else {
        nonnegative(x);
    }
}
```
